# LobotJR

An IRC bot that primarily runs the Wolfpack RPG for LobosJR on twitch. It also performs some moderation functions and a few other features that were added as needed.

## Status

This project is currently undergoing a major revision, and as such is not open to pull requests at this time. If you are interested in helping with this refactor effort, please contact either [LobosJR](https://twitter.com/Lobosjrgaming) or [EmpyrealHell](https://twitter.com/Empyrealhell) on Twitter for more information. 

This project was originally written by LobosJR - a main condition of any work done is he needs to understand the changes:
1. It's crucial that any changes be done and documented in a way that LobosJR could continue development, should a developer leave the project.
2. Final review of new changes and documentation is by LobosJR: project development follows his schedule and might go dormant for a while until he has time to review them.
